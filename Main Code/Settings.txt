---------------------------------------------
            valid setting values
---------------------------------------------
         Rocket Name: up to 20 characters of text
           Call Sign: ham radio callsign, 6 characters of text, future versions will transmit via morse code
     magSwitchEnable: 1 enable, 0 disable, if enabled startup will not proceed until magnet is sensed
	    TXenable: 1 enable telemetry, 0 disable telemetry
               TXpwr: telemetry TX power; integers between 0 and 23; 13=20mW, 15=30mW, 17=50mW, 20=100mW
          silentMode: 1 enables the audible beeper, 0 disables audible beeper
         startupTime: seconds from power-on until start of pre-flight sequence
            gTrigger: # of G's required to detect liftoff, between 1.5 and 5.0
   detectLiftoffTime: seconds of sustained gTrigger to detect liftoff, between 0.1 and 1.0
        apogee delay: # of seconds after apogee to fire charge, between 0.0 and 5.0
       mainDeployAlt: altitude to deploy mains, 100ft to 835ft
       maxRecordTime: if touchdown is not detected, recording will stop after this many seconds, between 300 and 4294
      pyroFiringTime: total seconds spent sending current to pyro charge, between 0.2 and 1.0
---------------------------------------------
            2 stage rocket mode
---------------------------------------------
             2 stage: 1 for 2-stage rocket, 0 for single stage rocket
 2stageIgnitionDelay: seconds after booster separation to light 2nd stage, between 0.0 and 8.0
boosterSeparateDelay: seconds after booster burnout to separate 1st stage booster, between 0.0 and 3.0
  2stageAltThreshold: minimum altitude that must be exceeded before 2nd stage can light, between 100 and 835 ft
 maxAngleOffVertical: if angle off vertical exceeds this value then 2nd stage won't light, between 0 and 90 degrees
      quaternionRotn: 1 enables quaternions, 0 uses modified DCM, quaternions are industry standard but modified DCM is just as accurate and much faster
