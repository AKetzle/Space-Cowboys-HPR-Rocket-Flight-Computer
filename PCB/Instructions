If you want just one or two PCBs, then PM me on Rocketry Forum.  I usually have spares laying around that I can send to you at about $20USD per copy.
Otherwise, follow the directions below to get 6 boards from expressPCB at about $110USD.  You will have to split them on your own with a hacksaw.

1)  Download the .pcb file
2)  Download the software from https://www.expresspcb.com/
3)  Open the file in the software
4)  Order the MiniBoard Plus 4-layer Option (3 boards for $110)
