If you want just one or two PCBs, then PM me on Rocketry Forum.  I usually have spares laying around that I can send to you at about $20USD per copy.
Otherwise, follow the directions below to get 3 sets of flight computer and ground station boards from expressPCB at about $90USD.  
You will have to split them on your own with a hacksaw or scroll saw.  There are two versions provided, one with the Sparkfun LSM9DS1 IMU stick and 
the other with the Pololu Mini IMU-9 with LSM6DS33 and LIS3MDL.  Due to the chip shortage the LSM9DS1 is nearly impossible to find right now.  The
base code is compatible with both versions.

1)  Download the .pcb file
2)  Download the software from https://www.expresspcb.com/
3)  Open the file in the software
4)  Order the MiniBoard Plus 4-layer Option (3 boards for $90)
